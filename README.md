# KaaS

This project is a simple Kubernetes as a Service. It allows users to create deployments, services, configmaps, secrets and ingresses they want and determine the docker iamge address and tag, number of replicas, resources and etc. KaaS also allows users to get status of a specific deployment or all of the deployments. The whole project is on cluster using helm. The project can create some predefined deployments such as Postgresql without any user specification (It uses some default values for creating the deployment). Another feature of this project is that it gets a health check API from user and creates a cron job to make requests to the API in specific durations and saves the results in a table so that users can be informed about the status of their application. Lastly this project uses Prometheus and Grafana to monitor the total number of reqests, number of unsuccessful requests, elapsed time by server to give the response of every request, number of errors in database and elapsed time by database.
